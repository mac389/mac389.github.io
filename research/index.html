<p>My overarching goal is to create computational versions of medical and scientific knowledge. To do so I use a combination a natural language processing, machine learning, and good old fashioned AI (GOFAI).</p>

<p>Current questions of interest include: (i) What are the spatiotemporal patterns of use of novel psychoactive substances?, (ii) Can we infer nover signal transduction pathways or even therapeutics from online discussions about novel psychoactive substance use?, and (iii) What representations of knowledge to we need to do (i) and (ii) at scale?</p>

<h3 id="syndromic-surveillance-of-social-media">Syndromic Surveillance of Social Media</h3>
<p>Novel psychoactive substances include synthetic opioids such as fentanyl or carfentanil, substituted phenethylamines, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bath salts'', and synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (</code>synthetic marijuana’’). The rate of emergence of these substances has outstripped the ability of traditional means of public health surveillance to identify the substances and presentations or toxicities of each substance. \textbf{The central finding of my work is that patterns of use of novel psychoactive substances can be estimated from social media (YouTube, Twitter, online discussion fora).} I demonstrated that this information was corroborated by accepted sources of information on substance use (National Survey on Drug Usage \&amp; Health) for opioids and dextromethorphan (an ingredient in cough syrup that in large amounts has euphoric and dissociative effects). These studies opened the door to using social media to discover new methods of abuse (e.g. abusing Immodium (loperamide) to prevent opioid withdrawal) and better understand the structure-function relationship in derivatives of MDMA (Ecstasy) using user reports submitted online. My specific role in the research described was as the lead investigator.</p>

<p>A main goal is to use modern technology to build the new instrumentation needed to understand these quantum materials. I learned my trade in <a href="http://davisgroup.lassp.cornell.edu/">Seamus Davis’ SI-STM lab</a> and with <a href="http://dpmc.unige.ch/gr_baumberger/index.html">Felix Baumberger</a>, and later moved as an <a href="http://www.ethfellows.ethz.ch/">ETH fellow</a> to <a href="http://www.qudev.ethz.ch/">Andreas Wallraff’s qudev lab</a> where we investigated coupled cavity arrays in circuit QED. This allowed me to learn new techniques such as high frequency measurements, low temperature noise-free amplification, and quantum-limited measurements. The goal is to combine these with SI-STM.</p>

<p>This will enable the instrumental capabilities to visualize the different quantum mechanical degrees of freedom needed to understand next-generation quantum materials. STM will be the main method, but we use different spectroscopic-imaging techniques to visualize not only the topography, but also the density of states, spins, and other degrees of freedom hidden below the surface.</p>
